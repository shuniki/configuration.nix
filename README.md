My first nixOS build! You can easily copy and paste or download these files into a new system. Just edit out the username and password and you should be good.

Desktop environments used:
- mate (Primary as of right now)

Desktop manager is lightdm.

Has:
- Flakes and Home Manager
- Amdgpu module, but you can comment it out easily.
- Tons of software i use!

Enjoy! ðŸŒŸ
